# XR Support in SRP
## Virtual Reality
To use VR in SRP, enable VR and choose a VR SDK in **Player Settings**. Aside from that, you can configure VR settings using the XRGraphicsConfig class that SRP Core provides. Currently, XRGraphicsConfig provides an interface to [XRSettings](https://docs.unity3d.com/2018.3/Documentation/ScriptReference/XR.XRSettings.html), which will be expanded to cover all knobs exposed by various XRSDK Subsystems as they become available.
